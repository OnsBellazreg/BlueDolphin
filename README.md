## Summary

The project is using a basic React setup using vite. The main diagram is enclosed in `components/DiagramWrapper` 
which uses [gojs-react](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-react) package further.

For initial run, you need 10K nodes that can be picked up by diagram, these nodes are generated by a script called `generator.js` in a file called `data.json`.
Once picked up, they are stored in browser's local storage to retain the updates made by the client.
